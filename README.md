# Blockchain-Validator-Anomaly-Detection
Proactive AI-driven monitoring for blockchain validators. Uses **Isolation Forest** to analyze telemetry (latency, participation, transaction inclusion) and detect malicious or unstable nodes in real time, preserving network integrity and fairness.

## Features
- Detects validator anomalies proactively
- Preserves transaction fairness
- Scalable to multiple validators
- Adaptive to changing network patterns

## Tech
- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
Run the `notebook.ipynb` to simulate validator telemetry, detect anomalies, visualize results, and assess business impact.
